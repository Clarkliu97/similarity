# Project Dev Report
Team: Penwell

## Project Description and Motivation 
Penwell is a diagnostic tool for writing decline. The system supports learning engineering by collecting historical writing data generated by students and analysing its quality over time. Interactive reporting dashboards help students, parents and teachers understand how student writing performance compares a month ago, a year ago, two years ago and so on, with attention given to high-frequency and trending writing errors.

## Project Status 
### Initial Stage
The project is delivered to the team with a functional prototype that can accept user input by uploading documents. At this stage, the prototype can receive the user inputs filter out the non-documents files, save the documents in the backend and display the list of documents in the frontend. 

### Client Demands
The client demands and the agreement can be found in the OneDrive repository.
